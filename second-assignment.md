Consider two firms that produce and sell cigarettes (differentiated products). The demand functions are:

$q_1=500-15p_1+5p_2+5sqrt{A_1}-3sqrt{A_2}$
$q_2=500+5p_1-15p_2-3sqrt{A_1}+5sqrt{A_2}$

$q_i$ denotes the quantity, $p_i$ the price per unit and $A_i$ the advertising expenditure of firm $i$, $i=1,2$. 
Marginal costs are constant and equal to 2 per unit for both firms. 

Consider a (one-shot pure) Nash equilibrium in which each firm sets its own price and advertising level, conditional on the price and advertising level of the competing firm. 

Derive the prices, advertising levels, quantities and profits in this equilibrium.
