<h1 id="q_i-denotes-the-quantity-p_i-the-price-per-unit-and-a_i-the-advertising-expenditure-of-firm-i-i12."><span class="math inline"><em>q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> denotes the quantity, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> the price per unit and <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> the advertising expenditure of firm <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 1, 2</span>.</h1>
<p>Marginal costs are constant and equal to 2 per unit for both firms.</p>
<h1 id="consider-a-one-shot-pure-nash-equilibrium-in-which-each-firm-sets-its-own-price-and-advertising-level-conditional-on-the-price-and-advertising-level-of-the-competing-firm.">Consider a (one-shot pure) Nash equilibrium in which each firm sets its own price and advertising level, conditional on the price and advertising level of the competing firm.</h1>
<h1 id="a-denote-the-prices-advertising-levels-quantities-and-profits-in-this-equilibrium.">a) Denote the prices, advertising levels, quantities and profits in this equilibrium.</h1>

<p>First, let's solve for the equilibrium price level of firm <span class="math inline">1</span>.</p>
<p>To do this, take the first order derivative with respect to <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>

<p>Solving for <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>1</sub></span> gives:</p>

<p>Similarly for firm 2 gives:</p>

<p>By substituting these best-response functions into each other, we can solve for the equilibrium price levels.</p>
<p>Note, that the firms are symmetric! This implies that price levels and advertisement levels of both firms are equal.</p>

<p>Second, let's solve for the equilibrium advertisement level of firm <span class="math inline">1</span>.</p>
<p>To do this, take the first order derivative with respect to <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>

<p>Solving for <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span> gives:</p>

<p>Now we have 2 equations, with 2 unknowns. We can substitute the functions into each other, which will gives the solution of the equilibrium price and advertisement levels.</p>
<p>The final solution is: <span class="math inline">$p_1^*=p_2^*=26, A_1^*=A_2^*=3600, q_1^*=q_2^*=360 &amp; \pi_1^*=\pi_2^*=5040$</span></p>
